    \ set its Move Characteristic to a value of 12 for the duration of the controlling\
    \ player's turn (sometimes referred to as 'activating' the jump pack). This allows\
    \ a model with a Warhawk jump pack to move up to 12\", regardless of the Movement\
    \ Characteristic shown on its profile and gain any other benefits of a Movement\

    \ must end its Movement at least 1\u201D away from any model from another unit.\
    \ \nA model with a Legion Warhawk jump pack may still Run if it would normally\
    \ be able to Run (this does not allow units that include any models with the Heavy\
    \ Sub-type to Run). When making a Run move for a model with an activated Legion\
    \ Warhawk jump pack, add the Initiative Characteristic of that model to 12 to\
    \ determine how far it may move - the model ignores terrain and models from other\
    \ units while making a Run move with a Legion Warhawk jump pack as previously\
    \ noted, but may not make Shooting Attacks or declare a Charge in the same turn\
    \ in which it has Run as per the normal rules for Running. \nAny model with a\
    \ legion Warhawk jump pack also gains the Bulky (2), Hammer of Wrath (1) and Deep\
    \ Strike special rules - if it already has the Bulky (2) special rule, it gains\
    \ the Bulky (3) special rule instead. During a Reaction made in any Phase, a player\
    \ may not choose to activate a model's Legion Warhawk jump pack to gain any bonus\
    \ to its Movement Characteristic. Any models with a Legion Warhawk jump pack deployed\
    \ as part of a Deep Strike Assault are considered to have activated their jump\
    \ packs in the turn that they enter play."
