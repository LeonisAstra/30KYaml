- Description: All models with the Daemon Unit Type and/or Psyker or Corrupted Sub-type
    must reduce their Toughness and Strength by -1 while they are within 6" of a model
    with this special rule. Models that also have this special rule are immune to
    its effects
  Name: Accursed
- Description: "The controlling player of any unit that includes one or more models\
    \ with the Psyker Unit Sub-type and a weapon or ability with this special rule,\
    \ may choose to activate this special rule before making any attacks with that\
    \ weapon or resolving the ability. To activate this special rule, the controlling\
    \ player must make a single Psychic check using the Leadership Characteristic\
    \ of any model in the unit that does not have the Independent Character special\
    \ rule.\n If the Check is successful, then the Strength value of all attacks made\
    \ with weapons or abilities with this special rule is Increased by +2 (in addition\
    \ to any modifiers the attack or weapon may already possess), this benefit is\
    \ applied only in the Phase in which these attacks are made and ends immediately\
    \ after that Phase is resolved. If the Check is failed then no benefit is gained,\
    \ but the models in that unit may attack as normal."

- Description: "Models with the Adamantium Will special rule gain an Invulnerable\
    \ Save against any Wound inflicted by a weapon with the Force or Psychic Focus\
    \ special rules and Wounds inflicted by Perils of the Warp \u2013 the value of\
    \ this Save is indicated in brackets after the rule. For example, a model with\
    \ Adamantium Will (5+) gains a 5+ Invulnerable Save against any Wound inflicted\
    \ by a weapon with the Force or Psychic Focus special rules and Wounds inflicted\
    \ by Perils of the Warp. If, for any reason, the Adamantium Will special rule\
    \ is presented without a value in brackets then consider the rule to be Adamantium\
    \ Will (5+)."

- Description: "An Apothecarion Detachment is selected as any other unit, using up\
    \ a single Force Organisation slot and bough in the same manner. However, before\
    \ the first turn begin and any models are deployed to the battlefield, all model\
    \ in an Apothecarion Detachment must be assigned to another unit from the same\
    \ Detachment of the army they were selected as part of. Legion Apothecaries that\
    \ have not selected a Legion Spatha combat bike or Legion Scimitar jetbike may\
    \ only be assigned to units composed entirely of models with the Infantry Unit\

    \ - if that unit is removed as a casualty, then the Legion Apothecary is removed\
    \ as well. \n In battles using Victory points, no Victory points are ever scored\
    \ for removing a Legion Apothecary as a casualty. When assigned to a unit, a Legion\
    \ Apothecary gains all of the special rules (with the exception of those that\
    \ specifically forbid it, such as the Bitter Duty special rule) and Unit Sub-types\
    \ listed for the unit to which it is attached, but does not gain access to any\

  Name: Ardex-defensor
- Description: "Before the start of the first turn, when placing units into Reserve,\
    \ a player must assign all models with this special rule in the army to Reserve\
    \ to perform an Area Denial Drop. At the beginning of the controlling player's\
    \ first turn, before any other models are moved or deployed, all of the Area Denial\
    \ Drop units must enter play using the procedure described below: \n Performing\
    \ an Area Denial Drop \n When deploying the Area Denial Drop, the controlling\
    \ player selects one of the available units to deploy first. Place a single model\
    \ from that unit anywhere on the battlefield that is at least 6\" from any enemy\
    \ model, battlefield edge or piece of Impassable Terrain and is outside of all\
    \ Deployment Zones. Do not scatter the model. If possible, the model must be placed\
    \ in a position that will allow any other models in the same unit to deploy (as\
    \ follows), and may only be placed in a position that denies the remainder of\
    \ the squad a place within unit coherency if no other position is available. \n\
    \ Once the model's final position has been decided, the remainder of the unit\
    \ may be deployed anywhere that is within unit coherency and more than 6\" from\
    \ any enemy model or piece of Impassable Terrain. Any models that cannot be placed\
    \ are removed as casualties. \n Once this first unit has been deployed, roll a\
    \ D6. On the roll of a '1', the Area Denial Drop is Disordered and the opposing\
    \ player may deploy each remaining unit in the Area Denial Drop anywhere within\
    \ 12\" of the first unit without scattering, though no model may be within 1\"\
    \ of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain. If the roll is a '2' or higher,\
    \ the controlling player deploys each remaining unit anywhere within 12\" of the\
    \ first without scattering, though no model may be within 1\" of an enemy model\
    \ or within Impassable Terrain. \n Once all units are deployed, any enemy units\
    \ within line of sight and range may choose to make the Interceptor Reaction (see\
    \ page 309 of the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook) targeting any one of\
    \ the units deployed as part of the Area Denial Drop. Any units that are chosen\
    \ to make the Interceptor Reaction do not expend any of the controlling player's\
    \ Reaction Allotment, but do count as having made a Reaction (and thus can React\
    \ again before the next Phase begins). Note that no Reaction other than Interceptor\
    \ may be made against the deployment of a unit as part of an Area Denial Drop.\
    \ \n Once all units from the Area Denial Drop have been deployed and any Interceptor\
    \ Reactions have been resolved, the turn proceeds as normal. Units that have been\
    \ deployed as part of an Area Denial Drop may not Move or Run in the Movement\
    \ phase of the turn in which they are deployed, but may Shoot and declare Charges\
    \ as normal (if the models deployed as part of the Area Denial Drop are allowed\
    \ to make Charges)."
  Name: Area Denial Drop
- Description: When deployed onto the battlefield (either at the start of the battle
    or when arriving from Reserves) all models in the unit must be placed within unit
    coherency, but afterwards operate independently and are not treated as a single
    unit.
  Name: Armiger Talons
- Description: A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule
    only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when attacking in close
    combat.
  Name: Armourbane (melee)
- Description: "A model or weapon with this Armourbane special rule only gains the\
    \ benefits of the Armourbane special rule when at half range or less. If the attack\
    \ is more than half its Maximum Range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If\
    \ a weapon with this version of Armourbane also has the Blast special rule (see\
    \ page 234), measure the distance to the centre of the Blast marker after it has\
    \ scattered. If this is half the weapon\u2019s range or less, then all Hits are\
    \ counted as having the Armourbane special rule, otherwise the Hits are resolved\
    \ as if they did not have the Armourbane special rule."
  Name: Armourbane (melta)
- Description: A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule
    only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when making Shooting Attacks.
  Name: Armourbane (ranged)
- Description: If a model or weapon has this special rule, it rolls an additional
    D6 for armour penetration when targeting a Vehicle model, or, when targeting a
    model with the Automata or Dreadnought Unit Type, re-rolls all failed rolls To
    Wound instead. These effects apply to both Shooting Attacks and close combat attacks.
    Some instances of the Armourbane special rule may include a qualifier after the
    rule in brackets, for example Armourbane (Melta) or Armourbane (Melee).
  Name: Armourbane (X)
- Description: At the start of each Shooting phase, the controlling player may nominate

  Name: Augurs Of Weakness
- Description: A Solar Auxilia Rapier Battery must have on Auxilia Gunner per Rapier
    Carrier in order forall Rapier Carriers to make Shooting Attacks in the Shooting
    phase. If at the start of any of the controlling player's Shooting Phases, the
    Solar Auxilia Rapier Battery contains fewer Auxilia Gunners than Rapier Carriers
    then only anumber of Rapier Carriers equal to the number of Auxilia Gunners make
    make Shooting Attacks in that Shooting phase. In addition, as long as there are
    at least as many Auxilia Gunners in the unit as there are Rapier Carriers, then
    the unit cannot be Pinned, automatically passing any Pinning test it is called
    upon to take without any dice being rolled (this benefit is immediately lost once
    the number of Auxilia Gunners is reduced to less than the number of Rapier Carriers
    in the unit).
  Name: Auxilia Artillerists

    Unit Type Embarking or Disembarking from a model with this special rule may do
    so from any point on the model's base, or its hull if it has no base.
  Name: Auxiliary Vehicle Bay
- Description: "All Barrage weapons use Blast markers and consequently use the rules\
    \ for Blast weapons, as indicated by their profile, with the following exceptions:\
    \ \n Barrage weapons can fire indirectly. This means they can fire at a target\
    \ that they do not have line of sight to, as long as the target is beyond their\
    \ Minimum Range (if applicable). When firing indirectly, the Ballistic Skill of\
    \ the firer is not subtracted from the scatter distance; unless a Hit is rolled\
    \ on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker always scatters a full 2D6\". If a Barrage\
    \ weapon has line of sight to its target it can fire directly, even if the target\
    \ is within its Minimum Range. \n Note that any Hits inflicted upon Vehicles by\
    \ an Attack using the Barrage special rule are always resolved against the Vehicle\u2019\
    s Side Armour Value. \n Multiple Barrages \n If a unit fires more than one shot\
    \ with the Barrage special rule, they fire together, as follows: The Barrage weapon\
    \ closest to the target unit fires first. Place the Blast marker over the target,\
    \ then roll for scatter as described earlier. Once the first marker is placed,\
    \ roll a Scatter dice for each other Barrage weapon shot fired by the unit. If\
    \ an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is\
    \ next to and touching the edge of the first marker placed (see diagram below).\
    \ If a Hit is rolled, the firing player places the marker so that it touches any\
    \ part of any marker in the group that has already been placed. Note that it is\
    \ perfectly fine if some markers are placed overlapping one another (including\
    \ being directly over the top of a previous marker). Once all of the markers are\
    \ in place, add up the number of Hits and roll To Wound for these Hits. To determine\
    \ Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the first Blast\
    \ marker that was placed in the Multiple Barrage. \n Apocalyptic Barrage \n An\
    \ Apocalyptic Barrage follows all of the rules for a Barrage weapon, but uses\
    \ the clover-shaped Apocalyptic Barrage marker. Before the marker is placed, the\
    \ attacker is allowed to rotate the marker about its centre to maximise the number\
    \ of models that could potentially be hit. Place the marker and roll for scatter\
    \ in the same way you would for a Blast. If the marker scatters, be careful to\
    \ maintain the same orientation as you move it. Once the final position of the\
    \ marker has been determined, roll a number of dice equal to the number of attacks\
    \ on the weapon\u2019s profile. So, for example, with a weapon with the type \u2018\
    Heavy 4, Apocalyptic Barrage\u2019, you would roll four dice. Each dice roll corresponds\
    \ to a \u2018strike\u2019 on one of the circles on the Apocalyptic Barrage marker.\
    \ For example, each roll of a 2 indicates a strike on circle number 2. Resolve\
    \ the strikes as for a Multiple Barrage, as if each were a Barrage attack that\
    \ had landed on that circle and hit all the models underneath it. To determine\
    \ Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the entire\
    \ Apocalyptic Barrage marker."
  Name: Barrage
- Description: "For the purposes of whether or not attacks of a Strength twice this\
    \ model\u2019s Toughness value inflict Instant Death, this model\u2019s Toughness\
    \ is increased by X, where X is the value in brackets after the name of this special\
    \ rule. If, for any reason, this special rule does not provide a value, then consider\
    \ the value of X to be 1. This special rule does not alter the scores needed by\
    \ To Wound rolls or any other Test or Check."
  Name: Battle-hardened (X)
- Description: "If a model with the Battlesmith (X) special rule is in base contact\
    \ with, or Embarked upon, one or more damaged Vehicles, Dreadnoughts or Automata\
    \ during the Shooting phase, they can attempt to repair one of them. If they do\
    \ so, the model that attempted the repair cannot shoot any \nweapons or use any\
    \ other abilities that would be used instead of making a Shooting Attack.Roll\
    \ a D6. If the result is equal to or more than the value listed in brackets as\
    \ part of this rule then one of the following options may be applied to any one\
    \ Vehicle, Dreadnought or Automata the model is in base contact with or Embarked\
    \ upon:\n \u2022 Restore a lost Hull Point.\n \u2022 Restore a lost Wound.\n \u2022\
    \ Repair a Weapon Destroyed result.\n \u2022 Repair an Immobilised result.\n If\
    \ a Weapon Destroyed result is repaired, that weapon can be fired in the following\
    \ Shooting phase. The Battlesmith cannot use this ability if they are Pinned or\
    \ Falling Back."
  Name: Battlesmith (X)
- Description: A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule must
    declare a Charge if able when they begin the Assault phase within 12" of an enemy
    unit. If there is more than one eligible target, the controlling player chooses
    the target of any Charges made. Note that this does not allow models with this
    special rule to Charge a different unit to one that they made a Shooting Attack
    against in the previous Shooting phase.
  Name: Bearers Of The Blood Hand
- Description: "At the start of the battle, once both armies have set up all their\
    \ models, including any units with the Infiltrator special rule, a player that\
    \ controls any models with this special rule may select one of the effects listed\
    \ below as part of this special rule. All units with the Kyropatris field generator\
    \ item of Wargear in the Detachment that includes the model with this special\
    \ rule gain the chosen effect for the duration of the battle. Note that only a\
    \ single bonus may be given to the units, regardless of how many models with this\
    \ special rule are present in the Detachment. If an army includes multiple Detachments\
    \ that include any models with this special rule, the controlling player must\
    \ select an effect for each such Detachment and may select the same or different\
    \ effects for each Detachment:\n \u2022 Pain Suppression Override:Affected models\
    \ gain the Feel No Pain (5+) special rule.\n \u2022 Explorator Synaesthesis:Models\
    \ in affected units gain the Move Through Cover special rule.\n \u2022 Deconstructive\
    \ Confluence: Models in affected units gain the Wrecker special rule.\n \u2022\
    \ Extinction Interlock:Models in the affected units gain the Preferred Enemy (Infantry)\

- Description: Whenever an Eversor Assassin is reduced to zero Wounds, but immediatly
    before the model is removed from the battlefield, every model, both friendly and
    enemt, within d^" suffers a S4 AP3 hit with the Fleshbane special rule. These
    hits count as a Shooting Attack originating froma weapon with the 'Flame' type.
  Name: Biological Overload
- Description: A unit that includes any models with this special rule may not be joined
    by any model that does not also have this special rule (this includes Legion Techmarines
    and Legion Apothecaries, which may not be assigned to a unit with this special
    rule unless they also have this special rule).
  Name: Bitter Duty
- Description: "When firing a Blast weapon, models do not roll To Hit. Instead, pick\
    \ one enemy model visible to the firer and place the Blast (3\") marker with its\
    \ hole entirely over the base of the target model, or its hull if the target is\
    \ a Vehicle. The hole at the centre of the marker must be within the weapon\u2019\
    s Maximum Range. You cannot place the Blast marker so that the base or hull of\
    \ any friendly model is even partially under it.\n The large area affected by\
    \ the blast means it is going to be very hard to miss completely. Nonetheless,\
    \ the shot might not land exactly where intended. Roll for the Blast marker to\
    \ scatter and subtract the firer\u2019s Ballistic Skill from the distance (if\
    \ any) that it scatters, to a minimum of 0\". Note that it is possible, and absolutely\
    \ fine, for a shot to scatter beyond the weapon\u2019s Maximum or Minimum Range\
    \ and line of sight. This represents the chance of ricochets, the missile blasting\
    \ through cover and other random events. In these cases, Hits are worked out as\
    \ normal and can hit and Wound units out of range and line of sight (or even your\
    \ own units, or models locked in combat). If the shot scatters so that the hole\
    \ in the centre of the marker is beyond the battlefield\u2019s edge, the shot\
    \ is a complete miss and is discarded.\n Once the final position of the Blast\
    \ marker has been determined, take a good look at it from above \u2013 each unit\
    \ suffers one Hit for each of the models included in that unit that is fully or\
    \ partially beneath the Blast marker, even if those models are not within the\
    \ firer\u2019s line of sight.\n Once the number of Hits inflicted on the unit\
    \ has been worked out, roll To Wound and Save as normal. Note that, unlike other\
    \ attacks, Wounds inflicted by an attack with the Blast special rule can be allocated\
    \ to any models in the target unit, even if they are out of sight of any models\
    \ from the attacking unit.\n Multiple Blasts\n If a unit is firing more than one\
    \ shot with the Blast special rule, scatter each shot, one at a time, as described\
    \ above and determine how many Hits are scored with each individual Blast marker.\
    \ After the last shot, add up the total number of Hits scored and roll all of\
    \ the To Wound rolls as normal.\n Blast Weapons and Re-rolls\n If a model has\
    \ the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit and chooses to do so after firing a\
    \ Blast weapon, the player must re-roll both the Scatter dice and the 2D6. Note\
    \ that this applies only to models able to fully re-roll a To Hit roll, not to\
    \ models that may re-roll To Hit rolls of a specific value \u2013 for example,\
    \ models that can re-roll To Hit rolls of a \u20181\u2019 cannot re-roll either\
    \ the Scatter dice or 2D6 unless another rule allows them to do so.\n Blast Weapons\
    \ and Snap Shots\n Blast weapons cannot be fired as Snap Shots.\n Large Blast\n\
    \ Large Blast weapons use the 5\" Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules\
    \ for Blast weapons.\n Massive Blast\n Massive Blast weapons use the 7\" Blast\
    \ marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.\n Apocalyptic Blast\n\
    \ Apocalyptic Blast weapons use the 10\" Blast marker, but otherwise obey all\
    \ the rules for Blast weapons.\n Apocalyptic Mega-blast (5\"/7\"/10\")\n Apocalyptic\
    \ Mega-blast weapons use the Apocalyptic Blast marker. They obey the rules for\
    \ Blast weapons, with the following exceptions:\n Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons\
    \ have three Strength values and three AP values. Correspondingly, the Apocalyptic\
    \ Blast marker is divided into three zones, as shown in the diagram on the next\
    \ page, one for each Strength and AP value.\n The Strength and AP of any Hits\
    \ depends on the zone in which the target model is located. The first Strength\
    \ and AP value are used for the inner zone, the second Strength and AP value are\
    \ used for the middle zone, and the third Strength and AP value are used for the\
    \ outer zone. Always use the best Strength and AP if a model straddles two or\
    \ more zones. If a unit has models in several zones, work out the Hits inflicted\
    \ for each zone separately. Note that there will be a different Wound Pool for\
    \ each zone.\n To determine whether a unit wounded by an Apocalyptic Mega-blast\
    \ weapon is allowed a Cover Save, and when determining Wound allocation, always\
    \ assume the shot is coming from the centre of the Apocalyptic Blast marker, instead\
    \ of from the firing model.\n Hits from Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons made against\
    \ Vehicles are always resolved against their Side Armour Value."
  Name: Blast
- Description: A Blast-shield is a Barricade and provides a 5+ Cover Save for models
    obscured by it. In addition, any Wounds inflicted by attacks with the Blast special
    rule targeting a model that claims a Cover Save due to a Blast-shield must be
    re-rolled.
  Name: Blast-shield
- Description: Any unit hit by one or more models or weapons with this special rule
    must take an Initiative test at the end of the current Phase. If the Test is passed,
    there is no further effect. If the Initiative test is failed, all models in the
    unit are reduced to Weapon Skill 1 and Ballistic Skill 1 until the end of their
    next turn. Should the attacking unit hit themselves, they automatically pass the
    Test. Any model that does not have an Initiative Characteristic (for example,
    Vehicles, Buildings, etc) is unaffected by this special rule.
  Name: Blind
- Description: "So long as a unit with this special rule contains at least five models\
    \ with galvanic casters, once per battle during the controlling player\u2019s\
    \ Shooting phase, the unit may make a Blind Barrage instead of making a Shooting\
    \ Attack. Select a friendly unit with a model within 18\" and within line of sight\
    \ of the unit making the Blind Barrage. That friendly unit gains the Shrouded\
    \ (4+) special rule until the beginning of the controlling player\u2019s next\
    \ player turn. Models with the Vehicle Unit Type, the Knight Unit Sub-type, the\
    \ Titan Unit Sub-type, or the Monstrous Unit Sub-type may not be the target of\
    \ a Blind Barrage."
  Name: Blind Barrage
- Description: When a unit composed entirely of models with this special rule declares
    a Charge targeting a unit that is Pinned or Falling Back, the Charge roll gains
    an additional +1 modifier, and if the Charge is successful then all models in
    the Charging unit gain +1 Attack for the duration of the turn in which that Charge
    is made.
  Name: Bloody Murder
- Description: When rolling To Wound for a model that has the Breaching (X) special
    rule, or is attacking with a weapon that has the Breaching (X) special rule, for
    each To Wound roll equal to or higher than the value listed in brackets, the controlling
    player must resolve these wounds at AP 2 instead of the weapon's normal AP value.
    This rule has no effect on models that do not have Wounds, such as models with
    the Vehicle Unit Type.
  Name: Breaching (X)
- Description: This model may re-roll all To Hit and To Wound rolls in close combat
    when attacking an enemy unit that includes one or more models with the Daemon
    Unit Type or the Psyker or Corrupted Sub-type.
  Name: Breakers Of Witches
- Description: When a model is allocated a Wound inflicted by a weapon with this special
    rule, it does not suffer only one Wound but instead suffers a number of Wounds
    equal to the number in brackets associated with the specific variant of this special
    rule, with all of the Wounds inflicted using the same AP and special rules as
    that of the initial Wound. Roll to save against each Wound inflicted separately,
    but note that Wounds caused in excess of a given model's remaining Wounds do not
    spill over to other models and are lost. This special rule has no effect on models
    that do not have a Toughness value.
  Name: Brutal (X)
- Description: "Bulky models count as a number of models equal to the value X in brackets\
    \ after the rule\u2019s name for the purposes of Transport Capacity and whether\
    \ a given unit outnumbers another in combat. For example, a unit comprised of\
    \ five models all of which have the Bulky (3) special rule, would count as 15\
    \ models when attempting to Embark on a Transport Vehicle or when deciding if\
    \ they outnumber an enemy unit."
  Name: Bulky (X)
- Description: A model with this special rule never suffers any penalties to its Leadership
    Characteristic from the Anathema Unit Sub-type.
  Name: Cerebral Pacifier
- Description: "When using a model with this special rule to make a Shooting Attack\
    \ using only Pistol type weapons, the controlling player may declare a Chain Fire\
    \ attack instead of making the model's normal Shooting Attacks during their own\
    \ player turn.\n While making a Chain Fire attack, a model with this special rule\
    \ may make up to six attacks in the same Shooting phase. Each of these attacks\
    \ must be made using either one or two Pistol type weapons, and all attacks must\
    \ target the same enemy unit. In each attack all weapons used must make their\

    \ they always Wound on a 2+."
  Name: Fleshbane
- Description: Any Psyker with a weapon or ability with this special rule may choose
    to make a Psychic check before making any attacks with that weapon or resolving
    the ability. If the test is successful then the Strength value of any attacks
    made is doubled. If the test is failed then a Perils of the Warp attack is resolved
    targeting the unit containing the model that failed its test. If the Psyker survives
    Perils of the Warp then it may attack as normal.
  Name: Force
- Description: "In games that allow the use of Fortifications, an Emperor\u2019s Children\
    \ Sun Killer Squad that has not selected a Dedicated Transport may instead select\
    \ a Defence Line (see the Warhammer: The Horus Heresy \u2013 Age of Darkness Rulebook)\
    \ without occupying a Fortification Force Organisation slot, but the cost in points\
    \ must be counted towards the army total."
  Name: Fortified Postion
- Description: At the start of the Assault phase, a model with this special rule may
    choose to temporarily increase it Attacks Characteristic by the amount listed
    in brackets until the end of the turn. When rolling To Hit for a model that has
    had its Attacks Characteristic increased in this manner, for each unmodified result
    of 1 the attacking model immediately suffers a Wound unless and Armour Save can
    be made.  Wounds inclifed in this manner do not count for the purposes of combat
    resolution.
  Name: Frenzon Rage
- Description: "In a turn in which a model with this special rule Charges into combat,\
    \ it adds a bonus to its Strength Characteristic until the end of the Assault\
    \ phase. The bonus added to the model\u2019s Strength is equal to the value in\
    \ brackets after the special rule, for example a model with Furious Charge (2)\
    \ adds a bonus of +2 to its Strength. \n A model that has made a Disordered Charge\
    \ that turn receives no benefit from Furious Charge (see page 182)."
  Name: Furious Charge (X)
- Description: A model with this special rule may add one to the number of shots fired
    when making a Shooting Attack with a shrapnel bolter or shrapnel pistol (but not
    with shrapnel cannon or Gravis shrapnel cannon or any other 'Bolt' weapon).
  Name: Fury Of Olympia

    tests.
  Name: Galvanic Traction Drive
- Description: "When firing a weapon that Gets Hot, roll To Hit as normal. For each\
    \ unmodified To Hit roll of 1, the firing model immediately suffers a single Wound\
    \ with an AP value equal to that of the weapon that was used to attack (Armour\
    \ Saves, Invulnerable Saves and Feel No Pain rolls can be taken, but not Cover\
    \ Saves or Shrouded rolls) \u2013 this Wound cannot be allocated to any other\
    \ model in the unit. A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 To Hit.\
    \ If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.\n Gets\
    \ Hot and Weapons that do not Roll To Hit \n Weapons that do not roll To Hit (such\
    \ as Blast weapons) must roll a D6 for each shot immediately before firing. On\
    \ a 2+, the shot is resolved as normal. For each roll of a 1, the weapon Gets\
    \ Hot; that shot is not fired and the firing model immediately suffers a single\
    \ Wound with an AP value equal to that of the weapon that was used to attack (Armour\
    \ Saves, Invulnerable Saves and Feel No Pain rolls can be taken, but not Cover\
    \ Saves or Shrouded rolls) \u2013 this Wound cannot be allocated to any other\
    \ model in the unit. A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 to Hit.\
    \ If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.\n Gets\
    \ Hot and Re-rolls\n If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit (including\
    \ because of BS 6+ or the Twin-linked special rule), a Wound is only suffered\
    \ if the To Hit re-roll is a 1; it may also re-roll Gets Hot results of 1 for\
    \ weapons that do not roll To Hit."
  Name: Gets Hot
- Description: "A model with this special rule ignores all Psychic Powers and Cybertheurgic\
    \ Rites and Attacks made by Psychic and Cybertheurgic Weapons. In addition, a\
    \ model with this special rule ignores the effects of the Haywire and Disruption\
    \ (X) special rules. In all cases, weapons which benefit from these special rules\
    \ must attempt to damage a model with this special rule normally using the attack\u2019\
    s Strength value. In addition, all friendly Mechanicum units with at least one\
    \ model within 24\" of a model with this special rule gain the Fearless special\
    \ rule."

  Name: Grav Wave
- Description: Instead of rolling To Wound normally with a weapon with this special
    rule, the controlling player of any model Hit by it must roll equal to or under
    that model's Strength Characteristic on 2D6 or it suffers a Wound (Armour Saves
    and Damage Mitigation rolls may be taken as normal - except Shrouded rolls which
    may not be used). Against targets with an Armour Value, the attacking player rolls
    4D6 for Armour Penetration instead.
  Name: Graviton Collapse
- Description: "Instead of rolling To Wound normally with this weapon, any non-Vehicle\
    \ model that suffers a Hit from a weapon with this special rule must instead roll\
    \ under their Strength on a D6 or suffer a Wound (a roll of a \u20186\u2019 always\
    \ counts as a failure). If a Graviton Pulse weapon also has the Blast type, then\
    \ leave the Blast marker in place after resolving all Wounds, or otherwise mark\
    \ the area. This area now counts as both Difficult Terrain and Dangerous Terrain\
    \ until the end of the next Game Turn."
  Name: Graviton Pulse
- Description: Before firing a weapon with this special rule, roll a D6. On a 1, the
    firing unit suffers a single Wound against which no Saves or Damage Mitigation
    rolls may be made. A model with the Vehicle Unit Type instead suffers 1 Hull Point
    against which no Saves or Damage Mitigation rolls may be made. On a 2-5, the weapon
    fires normally. On a result of a 6, the attack is carried out with the Vortex
    special rule.
  Name: Graviton Singularity

    and Legion Apothecaries, which may not be assigned toa unit with this special
    rule unless they also have this special rule).
  Name: Grim Purpose
- Description: At the start of any Assault phase, a Leadership test may be made for
    this unit by the controlling player against a Leadership of 7. If this test is

    their Weapon Skill characteristic to '5' for the duration of that Assault phase.
  Name: Guided By Prophecy
- Description: Any attacks made using a weapon with this special rule do not require
    line of sight, but must still be within range.
  Name: Guided Fire
- Description: "A unit that suffers one or more Hits from a Weapon with this special\
    \ rule must mnake an\n immediate Pinning test, adding one to the result of the\
    \ roll for each Hit scored by this attack before the result is decided. For example,\
    \ if a Psyker attacks an enemy unit that has a Leadership of 8, scoring 3 Hits\
    \ with Telepathic Hallucinations, then that unit must make an immediate Pinning\
    \ test and add 3 to the result rolled before determining the result."
  Name: Hallucinations
- Description: "If a model with this special rule ends its Charge Move in base or\
    \ hull contact with an enemy model, it makes a number of additional attacks equal\
    \ to the value in brackets listed as part of this special rule. These attacks\
    \ hit automatically and are resolved at the model\u2019s unmodified Strength with\
    \ AP-. These attacks do not benefit from any of the model\u2019s special rules\
    \ (such as Furious Charge, Rending, etc.). These attacks are resolved during the\
    \ Fight sub-phase at Initiative step 10, but do not grant the model an additional\
    \ Pile-in Move. \n If a model with this special rule Charges a Vehicle of any\
    \ kind or a Building, the hits are resolved against the Armour Value of the Facing\
    \ the charging model is touching. If the model is in contact with two or more\
    \ Facings, the player controlling the target model chooses a Facing upon which\
    \ the attacks are resolved. If a model with this special rule Charges a Building\
    \ or Vehicle that is a Transport, the hits are resolved against the Building or\
    \ Vehicle, not the unit Embarked within the Building or Vehicle."
  Name: Hammer Of Wrath (X)
- Description: A unit that includes any models with this special rule may not join
    or be joined by any model that does not also have this special rule (this includes
    Legion Techmarines and Legion Apothecaries, which may not be assigned to a unit
    that includes any models with this special rule). In addition, a unit that includes
    any models with this special rule never counts as a Scoring unit or a Denial unit
    regardless of any other special rules or Mission rules in use - however, a model
    with this special rule may re-roll all failed Shrouded Damage Mitigation rolls.
  Name: Harbingers Of The Legion

    phase as a result of an attack from a weapon with this special rule, must take
    a Morale check as if they had suffered 25% casualties.
  Name: Harrower
- Description: "This rule is presented as Hatred (X) where X identifies a specific\
    \ type of foe. If the special rule does not specify a type of foe, then the unit\
    \ has Hatred against everyone. This can refer to a Faction or a specific unit.\
    \ For example, Hatred (Mechanicum) means any model of the Mechanicum Faction,\
    \ whilst Hatred (Thallax) means only Thallax. A model striking a Hated foe in\
    \ close combat re-rolls all failed To Hit rolls during the first round of each\
    \ close combat. \n The effects of this special rule only apply when a unit that\
    \ has it begins an Assault phase not locked in combat and then either Charges\
    \ or is Charged by an enemy unit. If an enemy unit Charges this unit when it is\
    \ already locked in combat then that does count as a new \u2018first\u2019 turn\
    \ of combat for the effects of Hatred."
  Name: Hatred (X)
- Description: "When a weapon with this special rule Hits a model with the Vehicle,\
    \ Dreadnought or Automata Unit Type, roll a D6 to determine the effect rather\
    \ than rolling To Wound or for armour penetration normally. AP has no effect on\
    \ this roll: \n \u2022 1 No Effect. \n \u2022 2-5 Vehicles suffer a Glancing Hit,\
    \ other models suffer 1 Wound. Only Invulnerable Saves or Damage Mitigation rolls\
    \ may be taken against Wounds inflicted by this result. \n \u2022 6 Vehicles suffer\
    \ a Penetrating Hit, Dreadnoughts and Automata suffer 1 Wound. No Saves or Damage\
    \ Mitigation rolls may be taken against Wounds inflicted by this result."
  Name: Haywire
- Description: If a model with this special rule suffers an Explodes result on the
    Vehicle Damage table as a result of a Melee or Shooting Attack, the Explodes result
    causes nearby units to suffer a Str 8, AP 4 Hit for each model within D6+6" instead
    of the usual damage and area of effect.
  Name: Hazardous Munitions
- Description: "When a unit that includes at least one model with this special rule\
    \ has at least half of its models within 6\" of an Objective then all models in\
    \ the unit gain the Feel No Pain (6+) and Stubborn special rules. If any model\
    \ in the unit already has a variant of the Feel No Pain special rule then instead\
    \ increase the value in brackets of one of those rules by +1 while the unit has\
    \ at least half of its models within 6\u201D of an Objective (for example, a model\
    \ that already had Feel No Pain (5+) could choose to increase this to Feel No\
    \ Pain (4+) while it fulfils the conditions of this special rule)."
  Name: Heart Of The Legion
- Description: When a model with this special rule is deployed onto the battlefield
    using the Deep Strike special rule, and once all models arriving from Deep Strike
    in the same Phase have been placed in their final positions, but before any models
    Embarked on the model with this special rule have Disembarked, any models within
    3+D3" (friendly or enemy) suffer a Str 6 AP 5 Hit (models with the Vehicle Unit
    Type are struck on the Armour facing with the lowest Armour Value, and this attack
    counts as an attack from a Flame weapon). In addition, when moving in Hover mode,
    the controlling player may choose to inflict D6 Str 6 AP 5 Hits on any unit that
    a model with this special rule moves over. Any Wounds caused are allocated by
    the controller of the target unit, any models with the Vehicle Unit Type are struck
    on the Armour facing with the lowest Armour Value, and this attack counts as an
    attack from a Flame weapon. Once the model has finished moving, the controlling
    player must roll a D6 for each unit it has inflicted Hits upon using this special
    rule any results of a '1' inflict a Hull Point of damage on the model with this
    special rule.
  Name: Heat Blast
- Description: "When the weapon with this special rule is used to make a Shooting\
    \ Attack, draw a 1\u201D wide line from the end of the gun barrel up to the listed\
    \ range of the weapon - this is the beam area. The initial target for the weapon\
    \ (the model in the beam area closest to the attacking model) must be an enemy\
    \ model. \n \u2022 Models (friend and enemy) caught in the beam (excepting the\
    \ firing model) suffer a Hit with the listed profile of the weapon, except models\
    \ with the Flyer Sub-type which cannot be affected or targeted. \n \u2022 Units\
    \ with any models in the beam area receive a number of Hits equal to the number\
    \ of their models caught in the path of the beam; casualties are removed from\
    \ affected units using the normal rules for removing casualties. \n \u2022 If\
    \ a Terrain piece, Building, model with the Vehicle Unit Type or any model with\
    \ 6 or more Wounds is in the beam area, the attack is blocked and its line of\
    \ effect will no further than that model. The blocking model will, however, suffer\
    \ 1+D3 separate Hits, rather than just 1. \n \u2022 If a model with the Vehicle\
    \ Unit Type and the Transport Sub-type suffers a Penetrating Hit from a weapon\
    \ with this special rule, each unit Embarked on it suffers D6 Str 4 AP - Hits\
    \ with the Deflagrate special rule, in addition to any other effects. Any Wounds\
    \ caused are allocated by the controller of the target unit."
  Name: Heavy Beam
- Description: A model with this special rule has an Invulnerable Save of 6+ against
    Shooting Attacks.
  Name: Heavy Structure
- Description: "A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule that\
    \ is locked in combat can choose to leave close combat at the end of any Assault\
    \ phase. If the unit wishes to do so, it must take an Initiative test. \n If the\
    \ Test is failed, nothing happens and the models remain locked in the fight. \n\
    \ If the Test is passed, choose a direction \u2013 then roll 2D6 and add the unit\u2019\
    s Movement Characteristic to the result. As long as the distance rolled, in inches,\
    \ is sufficient to allow the entire unit to move over 1\" away from all of the\
    \ enemy units they are locked in combat with, the unit breaks away from combat\
    \ and must immediately move a number of inches in the chosen direction equal to\
    \ the 2D6 + Movement result, ignoring the models they were locked in combat with.\
    \ No Sweeping Advance rolls are made. Enemy units that are no longer locked in\
    \ combat immediately Consolidate a number of inches equal to their Initiative.\
    \ \n A Hit & Run Move is not slowed by Difficult Terrain, but does trigger Dangerous\
    \ Terrain tests as normal. It may not be used to move into base or hull contact\
    \ with enemy units, and models instead stop 1\" away. If there are units with\
    \ this rule on both sides who wish to disengage, roll off to determine who goes\
    \ first and then alternate disengaging them. If the last of these ends up no longer\
    \ in combat, it Consolidates instead."

- Description: "Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however,\
    \ join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the\
    \ Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type\
    \ or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful\
    \ multi-character unit.\n Joining and Leaving a Unit\n An Independent Character\
    \ can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency\
    \ with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which\
    \ unit it has joined.\n In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply\
    \ has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit\
    \ at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit\
    \ coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player\
    \ must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not\
    \ intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of\
    \ unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make\
    \ clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent\
    \ Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.\n\
    \ An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving\
    \ out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase\
    \ \u2013 once shots are fired or Charges are declared.\n An Independent Character\
    \ cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in\
    \ combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in\
    \ Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins\
    \ a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit\
    \ of one model at the start of the following Phase.\n While an Independent Character\
    \ is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though\
    \ they still follow the rules for Characters.\n Special Rules\n When an Independent\
    \ Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of\
    \ the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule),\
    \ the unit\u2019s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character,\
    \ and the Independent Character\u2019s special rules are not conferred upon the\
    \ unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as\
    \ the Independent Character is with them.\n Independent Characters and Infiltrate\n\
    \ An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit\
    \ of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.\n Independent Characters\
    \ and Ongoing Effects Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined\
    \ will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed\
    \ by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves\
    \ the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected\
    \ by the effect, so you\u2019ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.\n\
    \ Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been\
    \ the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have\
    \ been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect\
    \ are not shared."
  Name: Independent Character
- Description: After a model with this special rule (or a unit composed entirely of
    models with this special rule) has resolved a Shooting Attack targeting an enemy
    unit, any weapoins that were not used to attack (either due to being out of line
    of sight or range of the enemy uni, or because the controlling player voluntarily
    opted not to attack with them) may make a number of Secondary Shooting Attacks
    using thise weapons that did not fire as part of its initial Shooting Attack.
    Each weapon not fired as part of the initial Shooting Attack may be fired once,
    either in a single Secondary Shooting Attack, each in a seperate Secondary Shooting
    Attack targeting a different enemy unit or any combination - however, each weapon
    may only be used to attack once and in no more than one Secondary Shooting Attack.

  Name: Independent Fire Control
- Description: When deployed as the first model placed during a Deep Strike Assault,
    or other deployment that requires a model with this special rule to scatter, the
    distance the model scatters is reduced by half and if it scatters into Impassable
    Terrain or off of the battlefield then it is moved the minimum distance required
    to avoid such obstacles. In addition, if all units included in a Deep Strike Assault
    have the Inertial Guidance System special rule or are models Embarked on a model
    with that special rule then any rolls made to determine if the Deep Strike Assault
    is Disordered may be re-rolled.

    \ that Infiltrate in this way can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is\
    \ more than 9\" from any enemy unit, as long as no deployed enemy unit can draw\
    \ line of sight to them. This includes in a Building (see page 224), as long as\
    \ the Building is more than 9\" from any enemy unit. Alternatively, they can be\
    \ set up anywhere on the battlefield more than 12\" from any enemy unit, even\
    \ in plain sight.\n If a unit with Infiltrate deploys inside a Dedicated Transport,\

    \ one model with both the Master of the Legion and Legiones Astartes (Emperor's\
    \ Children) special rules from the same Detachment selected by the controlling\
    \ player as the Phoenix Terminator Squad's Leader for the purposes of this special\
    \ rule. A Phoenix Terminator Squad selected as a Retinue Squad does not use up\
    \ a Force Organisation slot and is considered part of the same unit as the model\
    \ selected as its Leader. A Phoenix Terminator Squad selected as a Retinue Squad\
    \ must be deployed with the model selected as its Leader deployed as part of the\
    \ unit and the Leader may not voluntarily leave the Retinue Squad during play.\
    \ One Phoenix Terminator in a Phoenix Terminator Squad selected as a Retinue may\

  Name: Phoenix Retinue
- Description: "If a non-Vehicle unit suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from a weapon\
    \ with the Pinning special rule, it must take a Leadership test once the firing\
    \ unit has finished its Shooting Attacks for that Phase. This is called a Pinning\
    \ test. If the unit fails the Test, it is Pinned. As long as the Test is passed,\
    \ a unit can be called upon to take multiple Pinning tests in a single turn, but\
    \ only once for each unit shooting at them.\n A unit that is affected by any of\
    \ the following conditions does not take Pinning tests, and if called upon to\
    \ do so is considered to automatically pass them:\n \u2022 The unit is locked\
    \ in combat.\n \u2022 The unit is already Pinned (the unit remains Pinned, but\
    \ takes no further Tests).\n \u2022 The unit is composed entirely of Vehicle models.\n\
    \ \u2022 The unit is Embarked on a Transport Vehicle.\n \u2022 The target unit\
    \ is affected by the Fearless special rule.\n A unit that has become Pinned cannot\
    \ Move, Run or Charge. It can only fire Snap Shots if it attacks during the Shooting\
    \ phase and cannot make Reactions in any Phase. At the end of its following turn,\
    \ the unit returns to normal and the unit is free to act as normal from then on.\
    \ Whilst it is Pinned, a unit is affected normally by enemy actions (for example,\
    \ it takes Morale checks as normal). If the unit is forced to move, for example\
    \ if it has to Fall Back, it returns to normal immediately. If assaulted, the\
    \ unit will fight as usual, but because they are not set to receive the Charge,\
    \ enemy units do not receive the Initiative penalty for assaulting a unit in Difficult\
    \ Terrain (see page 222), even if the unit is in Difficult Terrain. If a unit\
    \ becomes Pinned during a Charge, then that Charge automatically fails. Units\
    \ that are locked in combat cannot be Pinned and do not take Pinning tests."

  Name: Plasma Burn
- Description: "If a model has the Poisoned special rule, or is attacking with a Melee\
    \ weapon that has the Poisoned special rule, it always Wounds on a fixed number\
    \ (generally shown in brackets), unless a lower result would be required, when\
    \ attacking in close combat. In addition, if the Strength of the wielder (or the\
    \ Poisoned weapon) is higher than the Toughness of the victim, the wielder must\
    \ re-roll failed rolls To Wound in close combat.\n Similarly, if a model makes\
    \ a Shooting Attack with a weapon that has the Poisoned special rule, it always\
    \ Wounds on a fixed number (generally shown in brackets), unless a lower result\
    \ would be required. If no number is shown in brackets, the rule is Poisoned (4+).\n\

- Description: "If a model with this special rule, or attacking with a weapon with\
    \ this special rule, rolls equal to or higher than the value in brackets when\
    \ making a To Hit roll as part of a Shooting Attack, that shot is a \u2018Precision\
    \ Shot\u2019. For example, if a model with the Precision Shots (4+) special rule\
    \ rolls a 4 or higher when making a To Hit roll, then that attack is a Precision\
    \ Shot. \n Wounds from Precision Shots are allocated against a model (or models)\
    \ of the attacking player\u2019s choice in the target unit, as long as the target\
    \ model is in range and line of sight of the attacking model, rather than following\
    \ the normal rules for Wound allocation. \n Note that Snap Shots and shots from\
    \ weapons that scatter, or do not roll To Hit, can never be Precision Shots."
  Name: Precision Shots (X)
- Description: "If a model with this special rule, or attacking with a weapon with\
    \ this special rule, rolls equal to or higher than the value in brackets when\
    \ making a To Hit roll as part of a melee attack, that hit is a \u2018Precision\
    \ Strike\u2019. For example, if a model with the Precision Strikes (4+) special\
    \ rule rolls a 4 or higher when making a To Hit roll, then that attack is a Precision\
    \ Strike. \n Wounds from Precision Strikes are allocated against a model (or models)\
    \ of the attacking player\u2019s choice in the target unit, as long as that model\
    \ is engaged in combat with the attacking model\u2019s unit, rather than following\
    \ the normal rules for Wound allocation."

- Description: "This rule is presented as Preferred Enemy (X) where X identifies a\
    \ specific type of foe. If the special rule does not specify a type of foe, then\
    \ everyone is a Preferred Enemy of the unit. A unit that contains at least one\
    \ model with this special rule re-rolls failed To Hit and To Wound rolls of 1\
    \ if attacking its Preferred Enemy. This applies both to Shooting Attacks and\
    \ close combat attacks. \n If a model with this rule makes an attack against a\
    \ mixed unit which has one or more models to which their Preferred Enemy rule\
    \ pertains, but is not entirely composed of such models, it may still benefit\
    \ from the effects of Preferred Enemy for all attacks made against that unit.\
    \ For example, a model with Preferred Enemy (Independent Characters) may re-roll\
    \ failed To Hit and To Wound rolls of 1 against all of the models in a unit which\
    \ has been joined by an Independent Character."

    attacking unit.'
  Name: Psy-shock

    rule do not count for the purpose of resolving the winner of an Assault.
  Name: Pyromantic Desolation
- Description: A model which loses one or more Wounds to an attack with this special
    rule and survives has its Toughness value reduced by -1 for the rest of the battle.
    This effect is not cumulative with other attacks using the Rad-phage special rule,
    but can be stacked with other special rules that also reduce the Toughness Characteristic

    value of less than 1.
  Name: Rad-phage
- Description: In a turn in which a model with this special rule Charges into combat,

    Rage (see page 182).
  Name: Rage (X)
- Description: Once per battle, at the start of any of the controlling player's turns,
    this rule may be activated. Once activated, take a Leadership test for this model,
    if passed then all friendly units that are Pinned or Falling Back and have at
    least one model that can draw line of sight to the model with this special rule
    immediately rally, and are no longer Pinned or Falling Back and may act normally
    this turn

    \ by enemy models (including the effects of the Bulky special rule) \u2013 count\
    \ all models locked in the combat, not just those models that are engaged. Roll\
    \ once to determine the number of bonus Attacks all Rampaging models involved\
    \ in that combat receive that Phase. For example, a model with the Rampage (D3)\
    \ special rule that is outnumbered by the enemy in close combat receives D3 additional\
    \ Attacks in that Fight sub-phase. \n A model that has made a Disordered Charge\
    \ that turn receives no benefit from Rampage (see page 182)."

    who has won a combat. Additionally, they gain a bonus of +1 to the result of any
    Sweeping Advance roll they make in a combat that they are on the winning side
    of. These bonuses do not stack with any other rules that increase the amount of
    Wounds inflicted when calculating who has won a combat and the result of a Sweeping
    Advance roll
  Name: Ravaging Assault
- Description: "Any model making a To Wound roll in the Assault phase against a unit\
    \ composed entirely of models with this special rule reduces its Strength by -1\
    \ when determining the score required To Wound (this does not affect the attacking\
    \ unit's Strength for the purposes of inflicting Instant Death),. Additionally,\
    \ any To Hit rolls made in the Assault phase targeting a unit that includes one\
    \ or more models with this special rule, always count the majority Weapon Skill\
    \ of the target unit as 3, regardless of the actual Weapon Skill of the models\
    \ in that unit.\n A unit that includes models with this special rule may only\
    \ be joined by models with this special rule, or the Primarch Angron, and models\
    \ with this special rule may not join a unit that includes any models without\
    \ this special rule."
  Name: Ravening Madmen
- Description: A model making attacks as part of an Assault using a with this special
    rule, adds the value of (X) that is included as part of this special rule to its
    Initiative Characteristic. If a model has more than one weapon with this special
    rule then that model only increases the value of its Initiative by the value of
    the special rule on the weapon whose profile is used by that model to attack during
    the Fight sub-phase. A weapon that is not used to attack does not modify the model's
    Initiative Characteristic - models that may attack with more than one weapon,
    or models claiming the bonus for having a second weapon, may only add the value
    of the highest variant of this special rule and do not add the values together.
    For example, a model attacking as part of an Assault with a weapon that has the
    Reach (1) special rule increases its Initiative by +1.
  Name: Reach (X)

    \ by its Catastrophic Damage is altered depending on the value of (X) in the version\
    \ of this special rule as follows:\n \n Magna\n When destroyed, a model with this\
    \ special rule resolves Hits caused by Catastrophic Damage as Destroyer attacks.\n\
    \ \n Major\n When destroyed, a model with this special rule resolves Hits caused\
    \ by Catastrophic Damage as Destroyer attacks at AP2.\n \n Maxima\n When destroyed,\
    \ a model with this special rule resolves Hits caused by Catastrophic Damage as\
    \ Destroyer attacks at AP2, and doubles the range of the Catastrophic Damage effect."
  Name: Reactor Meltdown (X)

  Name: Relentless
- Description: "If a model has the Rending special rule, or is attacking with a Melee\
    \ weapon that has the Rending special rule, there is a chance that their close\
    \ combat attacks will strike a critical blow. For each To Wound roll equal to\
    \ or higher than the value listed, the target automatically suffers a Wound, regardless\
    \ of its Toughness. The controlling player may choose to resolve these Wounds\
    \ at AP 2 instead of the weapon\u2019s normal AP value. \n Similarly, if a model\
    \ makes a Shooting Attack with a weapon that has the Rending special rule, a To\
    \ Wound roll of equal to or greater than the listed value wounds automatically,\
    \ regardless of Toughness, and is resolved at AP 2. \n In either case, against\
    \ Vehicles each Armour Penetration roll of equal to or greater than the listed\
    \ value allows a further D3 to be rolled, with the result added to the total Strength\
    \ of the attack. These Hits are not resolved at AP 2, but are instead resolved\
    \ using the weapon\u2019s AP value. \n For example, a model with the Rending (5+)\
    \ special rule that rolls To Wound against a non-Vehicle model will wound automatically\
    \ on the roll of a 5+, and the attacking player has the choice of using an AP\
    \ value of 2 instead of the AP value of their weapon."
  Name: Rending (X)
- Description: In any of the controlling player's Shooting phases, instead of making
    any Shooting Attacks with a model with this special rule, the controlling player

    unit selected in this manner is considered a 'Retinue Squad' and the model with
    the Master of the Legion special rule is referred to as the Retinue Squad's Leader
    for the purposes of this special rule (if the Detachment includes more than one
    model with the Master of the Legion special rule then the controlling player selects
    one as the unit's Leader). The Retinue Squad does not use up a Force Organisation
    slot and is considered part of the same unit as the model selected as its Leader.
    The Retinue Squad must be deployed with the model selected as its Leader deployed
    as part of the unit and the Leader may not voluntarily leave the Retinue Squad

    \ a Scout redeployment cannot Charge in the first Game Turn. A unit cannot Embark\
    \ or Disembark as part of a Scout redeployment.\n If both sides have Scouts, roll\
    \ off; the winner decides who redeploys first. Then alternate redeploying Scout\
    \ units one at a time. If a unit with this special rule is deployed inside a Dedicated\
    \ Transport, it confers the Scout special rule to the Transport (though a Disembarkation\
    \ cannot be performed as part of the redeployment). Note that a Transport with\
    \ this special rule does not lose it if a unit without this special rule is Embarked\
    \ upon it. Having Scout also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Scouts\
    \ that are kept as Reserves (see page 309).\n Infiltrate and Scout\n If a unit\

    \ and the rest of the template covers as many models in the target unit as possible,\
    \ without touching any other friendly models (including other models from the\
    \ firing model\u2019s unit). Any models fully or partially under the template\
    \ are hit. Against Vehicles, the template must be placed to cover as much of the\
    \ Vehicle as possible without touching a friendly model. The position of the firer\
    \ is used to determine which armour Facing is hit \n (see page 207). A Template\
    \ weapon never hits the model firing it.\n Template weapons have the Ignores Cover\
    \ and Wall of Death special rules. Wounds inflicted by Template weapons are allocated\
    \ following the normal rules.\n Multiple Templates\n If a unit is firing more\
    \ than one shot with the Template type, resolve each shot, one at a time, as described\
    \ above, determining and recording how many Hits are scored by each template.\
    \ Once the number of Hits from all templates has been determined, roll To Wound\
    \ as normal.\n Wall of Death\n Template weapons can fire Snap Shots at any non-Flyer\
    \ target. If a Template weapon fires as a Snap Shot, it automatically inflicts\
    \ D3 Hits on the target unit, resolved at its normal Strength and AP value, as\
    \ long as the target unit either has at least one model within 8\" or if the target\
    \ unit is resolving a Charge against the unit making the Shooting Attack. If the\
    \ weapon is also a Hellstorm weapon then it instead inflicts D6 Hits.\n Hellstorm\
    \ Weapons\n Hellstorm weapons have the word \u2018Hellstorm\u2019 instead of a\
    \ range on their weapon profile. Hellstorm weapons use the Hellstorm template\
    \ (see page 152), but otherwise obey the rules for other Template weapons."

    the Reacting unit may also Move or make a Shooting Attack as described in the
    Reaction being made (all units that Move or Shoot are counted as habing made a

- Description: "Once an attack with this special rule has been fully resolved, any\
    \ Blast markers placed as part of that attack are not removed from play and instead\
    \ are left in place for the remainder of the battle. Such a Blast marker is then\
    \ referred to as the Vortex marker. The area under a Vortex marker is treated\
    \ as Area Terrain for the remainder of the battle, and applies the following effects\
    \ to all models that enter its boundaries:\n \n No line of sight may be drawn\
    \ through, into, or out of the area covered by the Vortex marker (as such, models\
    \ within such an area of terrain cannot draw line of sight to any other model,\
    \ nor can other models draw a line of sight to them).\n \n Any models that enter\
    \ the boundary of this area of terrain, or begin the Movement phase of the model\u2019\
    s Controlling player within its boundaries, immediately suffer one Str 10, AP\
    \ 1 Hit and the Instant Death and Armourbane (Melee) special rules. If the model\
    \ has the Vehicle Unit Type and suffers a Penetrating Hit due to this effect then\
    \ it adds a modifier of +3 to that roll on the Vehicle Damage table instead of\
    \ the +2 modifier it would normally add due to being AP1.\n \n This area of terrain\
    \ does not confer a Cover Save and no model within its boundary may use a Cover\
    \ Save granted by any other rule or effect."

    \ This modifier is not cumulative, and any given unit can only be affected by\
    \ a single instance of the Vox Silence special rule at a time. Nor is it cumulative\
    \ with other special rules that negatively modify Leadership. Always use the highest\
    \ single modifier among those applicable. In addition, units affected by this\
    \ special rule do not gain the benefits of nuncio vox, command vox or other similar\
